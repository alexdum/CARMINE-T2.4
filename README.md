# CARMINE-T2.4

This is the GitHub repository set up for the implementation of post-processing tools for calculating climate indicators.

The repository is organized with a folder for each CSA, containing a .txt file to record progress. Within each folder, the python codes for each CSA will be developed.

Please comment with a small message every push you make, so it's easier to understand the modifications made
